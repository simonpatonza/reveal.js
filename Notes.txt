BA Training
- Web and Security frameworks (Mike B.) - 15mins
- SOA Presentation (Simon P.) - 15mins

Web
- framework â€“ what it is and what it is not
- What is this front end / JavaScript driven framework stuff people talk about
- The security framework

The framework interests analysts mostly from the perspective of a) when we are planning, how much does the framework actually do that does not need further custom coding? And b) what features are built into it (i.e. automatic benefit that is passed on to client)

EFTemplate
- Base template for creating apps
- Files and folders structure
- No business logic

- Entity Framework
	- Version 6
	- No setup of core data access libraries required
	- Point to database and generate files
	- However, does need wrappers to be created (covered in MVP section)
- MVP
	- Interface based, means different layers aren't tied together
	- More testable code
	- Overhead: extra layers of abstraction
- UIBase
	- Tishman Speyer
	- Open Box
- Unit/Integration Test template/examples

- Considerations
	- time to rename project(s), files etc to new project name
	- new client app would require styling/branding Front

modifications-end/JavaScript driven frameworks
- AngularJS
- KnockOut
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

Security Framework
- Active Directory driven
- WebForms only in OpenBox implementation
- Considerations
	- time required for creating a WebForms implementation for a client
	- new implementation needed per new client (small overhead)
