SOA
How can/should we apply it in the context of our application design?

---
SOA is not...
Limited to web services
The end goal

SOA is...
Loosely coupled
Application agnostic
For a specific purpose
Self-contained
A reusable business process

Considerations for SOA approach
Longevity - will it be reusable for long?
Performance
Asynchronous - shouldn't lock
Time/Productivity
Legacy - don't just build SOA on top of it
Security - more exposed to attack

"Business Service Bus" - concept by CBDI (http://everware-cbdi.com/)
What is this, and how does it apply to you?
Logical view of the available and used services for a particular business domain
This guides developers to the set of services available for (their domain)/(the domain they're working on)
Services on this bus should have the same common specifications, policies, etc
Eg: standards, security policies

Open Box SOA
Email Service (intially from TS-CDT, but was used in OM/LDG)
ACS (SAM)
- custom Security Provider required (based off common template)
