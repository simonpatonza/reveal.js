SOA
How can/should we apply it in the context of our application design?

---
SOA is not...
Limited to web services
The end goal

SOA is...
Loosely coupled
Application agnostic
For a specific purpose
Self-contained
A reusable business process

Considerations for SOA approach
Longevity - will it be reusable for long?
Performance
Asynchronous - shouldn't lock
Time/Productivity
Legacy - don't just build SOA on top of it
Security - more exposed to attack
